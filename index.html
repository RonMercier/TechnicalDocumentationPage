			<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.  It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical contructions than other languages.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> - Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it.</li>
					<li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> - You can actually  sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write you programs.</li>
					<li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> - Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates  code within objects.</li>
					<li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> - Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to browsers and games.</li>
				</ul>

		<header>History of Python</header>
			<p>	Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathmatics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. <br>
				Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages. <br>
				Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License. <br>
				Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Features">
		<header>Features</header>
		<p>Python's features include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Easy-to-learn</strong> - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and clearly defined syntax.  This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
				<li><strong>Easy-to-read</strong> - Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
				<li><strong>Easy-to-maintain</strong> - Python's source code is faily easy-to-maintain.</li>
				<li><strong>A broad standard library</strong> - Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Mac.</li>
				<li><strong>Interactive Mode</strong> - Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
				<li><strong>Portable</strong> - Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
				<li><strong>Extendable</strong> - You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter.  These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
				<li><strong>Databases</strong> - Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases</li>
				<li><strong>GUI Programming</strong> - Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system call, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Mac, and the X Window system of Unix</li>
				<li><strong>Scalable</strong> - Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>

		<header>Installing Python</header>
			<h1>Windows Installation</h1>
				<p>Here are the steps to install Python on Windows machine.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Open a Web browser and go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>
						<li>Follow the link for the Windows installer python-XYZ.msi file where XYZ is the version you need to install.</li>
						<li>To use this installer python-XYZ.msi, the Windows system must support Microsoft Installer 2.0. Save the installer file to your local machinee and then run it to find out if your machine supports MSI.</li>
						<li>Run the downloaded file. This brings up the Python install wizard, which is really easy to use.  Just accept the default settings, wait until the install is finished, and you are done.</li>
					</ul>
			<h1>Unix and Linux Installation</h1>
				<p>here are the simple steps to install Python on Unix/Linux machine.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Open a Web browser and go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>
						<li>Follow the link to download zipped source code available for Unix/Linux.</li>
						<li>Download and extract files.</li>
						<li>Editing the Modules/Setup file if you want to customize some options.</li>
						<li>run ./configure script</li>
						<li>make</li>
						<li>make install</li>
					</ul>
				<p>This installs Python at standard location /usr/local/bin and its libraries at /usr/local/bin/pythonXX where XX is the version of Python.</p>

		<header>Which version of Python should I use?</header>
			<p><em>Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.</em><br>
			You should use Python 3 going forward, because as of January 2020 Python 2 will be in EOL (End of life) status.  Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x version 2.7 release came out in mid-2010, with a statement of extended support for this end-of-life release.  The 2.x branch will see no new major releases after that.  3.x is under development and has already seen over five years of stable releases, including version 3.3 in 2012, 3.4 in 2014, 3.5 in 2015, 3.6 in 2016. This means that all recent standard library improvements, for example, are only available by default in Python 3.x.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
		<header>Hello, World!</header>
			<p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax.  It encourages programmers to program without prepared code.  The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).<br>
			<strong>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</strong></p>
				<code class="box"><span style="color:blue;" >print</span>("Hello, World!")</code>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Performing_Calculations">
		<header>Performing Calculations</header>
			<p>Next, let's take a simple calculation and feed it through the interpreter to see what happens.<br>
			<strong>Enter the following:</strong></p>
				<code>7+2</code>
			<p>After typing in the equation above and hitting enter - to submit - you should see something like the following:</p>
				<code>>>> 7+2<br>9</code>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Creating_your_first_string">
		<header>Creating Your First String</header>
			<p>A string is a sequence of characters that can be processed by a computer.  The string is usually stored for manipulation later.  strings must always begin and end with the same character, this is a requirement.  In addition you can use either single or double quotations to signify a string, there is no difference between the two.  The quotation marks only serve to inform Python that what's inside of them is a string. <br>
			Let's save your name as a string to call upon later.  To do that, type the following in the interpreter.</p>
				<code>>>> "Bob"<br>'Bob'</code>
			<p>Congrats! You just created your first string, and this is signified by the information sent back to you. We can see that the name was saved as a string.<br>
			Now, we want to test out this string and see what kinds of things we can do with it.  First, let's use multiple strings in tandem.  Enter the following in the interpreter:</p>
				<code>>>> "Hello there " + "my name is  " + "Bob"<br>'hello there my name is Bob'</code>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Storing_Variables">
		<header>Storing Variables</header>
			<p>Variables are nothing more than names or titles for a particular set of data so that you can store them and call upon them later.<br>
			Let's create a new variable of our own:</p>
				<code>>>> movie = "Terminator"</code>
			<p>Our variable is "movie" and in that variable we stored the data "Terminator," as you can see. You may be wondering how we know the variable was actually stored?  You can test this by simply entering "movie" in the interpreter and hitting enter.  It should return the data stored in that particular variable, like so:</p>
				<code>>>> movie<br>'Terminator'</code>
			<p>Good job! You created your first variable! Feels great, doesn't it?</p>
	</section>
	<section class="main-section" id="Comparisons">
		<header>Comparisons</header>
			<p>One remarkably useful - yet underrated - Thing you can do with a programming language is compare sets of data.  Let's try that now, using numbers.</p>
				<code>>>> 7 > 2<br>True<br>>>> 9 < 1<br>False<br>>>> 6 > 2 * 4<br>False<br>>>> 3 == 3<br>True<br>>>> 5 != 2<br>True</code>
			<p>Notice how we used two equal signs (==) to check if sets of data are equal?  You must always use two equal signs if that's what you are trying to do.  This is because a single equal sign, or "=" is used to assign a value to a variable.  In addition, if you want to check whether or not two values are unequal you can use an exclamation mark followed by an equal sign like so: "!="</p>
